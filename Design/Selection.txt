	The selection of individuals for populations of the next generation wil
be done as follows:

Selection(generation):
	sort generation by fitness
	add top 2 individuals to nextGeneration
	until(nextGeneration is full)
			     isolate 20 individuals
			     pick the top two individuals(out of 20)
			     make two children from top individuals
			     (mutate children)
			     add children to nextGeneration

The mating will be using single point crossover and voxels are the level of
grainularity
