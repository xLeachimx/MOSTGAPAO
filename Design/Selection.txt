	The selection of individuals for populations of the next generation wil
be done as follows:

Selection(generation):
	sort generation by fitness
	add top 2 individuals to nextGeneration
	until(nextGeneration is full)
			     randomizeOrder(generation)
			     sort the first 20 individuals by fitness
			     pick the top individual(according to pop1)
			     pict the top individual(according to pop2)
			     make two children from top individuals
			     (mutate children)
			     add children to nextGeneration

The mating will be using single point crossover and characters are the level of
grainularity
