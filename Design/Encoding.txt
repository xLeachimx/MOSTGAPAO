	Considering the need for the gentics to be shared by both populations
in this algorithm I find it nessecary to lay down just what each population is 
in charge of:

Population 1:
	   position of individual voxels
Population 2:
	   size of individual voxels

For reference the voxels being used are spheres of varying sizes
