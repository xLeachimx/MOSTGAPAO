The two variables will be in play they are as follows:
    1) Size
    2) position
For reference the voxels being used are spheres of varying sizes

Position will be denoted by the use of three bytes:
	 1) X
	 2) Y
	 3) Z
The size of the voxel will be dtermined by the average of the X,Y,and Z using
integer division

Also size will be defined as ((X | Y) ^ Z). By using these bitwise operators size
is also an unsigned character
