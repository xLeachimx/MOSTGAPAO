	Considering the need for the gentics to be shared by both populations
in this algorithm I find it nessecary to lay down just what each population is 
in charge of:
Population 1:
	   position of individual voxels
Population 2:
	   size of individual voxels

For reference the voxels being used are spheres of varying sizes

Position will be denoted by the use of three bytes:
	 1) X
	 2) Y
	 3) Z
The size of the voxel will be dtermined by the average of the X,Y,and Z using
integer division
